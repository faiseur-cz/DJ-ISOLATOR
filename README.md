# DJ-ISOLATOR
Open-source project of a 3-band "dj isolator"

When i built my first Pathos rotary mixer, a clone of the infamous Bozak CMA-10-2DL, by australian engineer Miles Stevens-aka Fabric Astronaut-, I knew i needed an isolator... so i bought 3 PCBs, from different horizons... i payed a sh+t lot of money for them... and although they worked well, i thought they were not worth it... dont get me wrong! im not criticizing the products, they are all great and amazing, but i felt i could just make it myself, for less money...
Of course, i ended up paying way more... somehow the price of self satisfaction... I learned a lot - and hopefully you will too!

anyway, lets not loose the point!

I basically copied everything from the very generous ESP (Elliott Sound Products) website.. under project numbers :
- Project 09 : 3-Way Linkwitz Riley Crossover
- Project 153 : Frequency 'Isolator' Equaliser
And a lot of other tips from this great knowledge base.

It is a 24dB/oct filter, with frequencies set up at 310Hz and 3k1Hz. You can change those values up to your tastes, for this I can only advise you to fly on ROD ELLIOTT's WEBSITE!!
You can use high quality potentiometers RK27 or more standard ones (i like center detent in those spots).
Either Molex or IDC 10pins connectors are possible for In/Out and power.
